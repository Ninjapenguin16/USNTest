# USN Tracker

This program uses the Windows API and the built in USN journal to track all changes made to an NTFS formated drive

It is ready to use out of the box but if you intend to use the blacklist or whitelist feature you must have the "Lists" folder in the same directory, "Blacklist.txt", and "Whitelist.txt"
